# Summary

Wasn't finding any really fast bracket to mount a fan to the power supply in the wait that I build a complete lower section with fan support. The stock power supply cry for cooling. It get way too hot.

Also all support I found were to mount the fan at the top. Since hot air rise, I found that mounting the fan at the bottom of the power supply was better.

If you have the same power supply than me ( i.e. the 20A stock power supply supplied with the Anet A8 ) that bracket should snap in place in the holes of the grid. I included a bracket with hole spacing to accomodate a 92mm or a 80mm fan. Just print the one that will fit the fan you plan on using.

If you want to edit it further instead of going thru the whole process of remaking a 3D model out of a STL please give credits if you remix thanks : https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3344cda09bbb1e40a22ea094/w/dabe15396eae112b5522938d/e/c1b0596520d979756f4c083d
