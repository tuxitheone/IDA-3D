Anet A8 Upper Frame Support by Malcy is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

# Summary

This frame brace will ensure the upper part of your Anet A8 (or similar) will remain at 90°.  It helps to take out any of the flex caused by filament holders or X travel.

It is my own design but inspired by what I have seen elsewhere.  

These were a fairly tight fit to my frame, they did not require ant tweeking, but your printer calibration might not be the same as mine, please bear that in mind if you have issues with fitment.

Please not the pictures of mine have my initials in them rather than "Anet A8"  I thought that would be better for the community.
Also, these were the first items I printed in the blue PLA.  The quality wasn't as good as I expected or as I was getting before with the white PLA from Gearbest.  I think it's just a temperature issue, when I get it sorted I will upload more photos.

##UPDATE##

I messed about with different temperature settings for the blue PLA, the original (seen fitted to the A8) was printed at 200°C, the picture with two frame supports has the original (left) and new (right) which was printed at 185°C.  This now looks much better.

The blue PLA is "Filamentum" from 3D FilaPrint on Amazon.  Not sure if I like it yet, I might try some other brands next.

Let me know if you have any issues.
