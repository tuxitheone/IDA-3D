# Summary

Manual bed leveling the Anet A6/A8 is a little awkward and could be made a lot easier. There are some good solutions on the net - I took the best, made modifications and kept it simple.

This solution allows you to cover the entire hotbed with a build plate as you no longer need access to adjusting bolts from the build surface. All adjustment is done with the thumbwheels!

All metal! at the hot end - this allows you to heat up the bed for ABS, Nylon and other high temperature filaments without melting your bed level adjustment.

*>> Don't forget, if you like it, please leave a like or a tip...  :)*

**From the kit you will need:**
- 4x Springs
- 4x Screw M3*30

**Additional you will need:**
- 8x M3 Nut (Optional: Use self-locking nuts for thumbwheels)
- 4x Steel/nylon M3 washer (Optional: I used large, but regular is OK)
- 4x Spring Cap (Print model)
- 4x Thumbwheel (Print model)
- A 3mm or 1/8" drill for stripping M3 thread

**Note:** To make this bed level upgrade, you need to strip the M3 thread in the Y carriage aluminum frame. This can not be reversed.

If your heatbed has copper traces under the washers, I recommend using nylon washers instead of metal to protect the heating element ([eBay Search](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=m3+nylon+washer)).

Just follow the photos to assemble.The M3 nuts is a tight fit in the thumbwheels to prevent them falling out.

**2018 January 13.: Added thumbwheel for Nylock nuts.**
