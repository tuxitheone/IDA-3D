Anet v1.0 & v1.1 Mainboard Cover with 40/50mm Fan by Leo_N is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial - Share Alike license.

# Summary

This is my first contribution to the Anet printer community.

It is well known that the Anet mainboard needs cooling for safer usage.

I designed this cover and fitted a 40mm fan to cool the mainboard, specifically for the components with heat sinks.
All wiring and connectors are accessible without having to remove the cover.

To mount the fan to the cover use 4 x M3x18 screws, 4 x M3 nuts and 8 washers.

You can use the same 4 screws holding the mainboard to the frame to mount the cover if you have an Anet A8 printer.
I would recommend test fitting the screws before mounting the cover to the frame. Be careful not to break the pegs. 
The holes for the screws are printed in 3 mm diameter. You might need to use a 3mm drill bit if the screws fit too tight. This depends on the tolerances of your printer.

I recommend using a Scythe Mini Kaze Case FAN 3500rpm fan.
It is hooked up to the 12V input "Power Supply" on the mainboard.

Please view the pictures for more details.

I hope this cover is useful to others.

If you made one please also post a picture of your setup with the cover.

Thanks. 

Leo

<H5>Update 14.01.2016:</H5>I've included a version for a 50mm fan which is mounted on the outside. You will need M4 screws. This thing is still work in progress.<BR>

<H5>Update 20.01.2016:</H5>I've included two new files (40mm and 50mm) to fit the newer Anet mainboard v1.1.
