# Summary

This frame brace is intended for mounting at the front of an Anet A8 3D printer. I made it because it compliments the design of my rear brace (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1852358).

<b>Note for models sometime prior to mid 2017:</b> The front acrylic frame is NOT symmetrical. Make sure that the side marked 104mm is mounted on the right side. This will also ensure that belt is running parallel to the guide rods. See pictures for details on mounting.
This brace will also fit newer models.

Make sure that your slicer program is set to 100% scale. You will also need to rotate to object to make it fit on the heat bed.

Please let me know if you have a problem with the design so I can improve it if necessary.

Also please post a picture with comments if you have made one.

Thanks.

Leo

Version 1.2 uploaded which addresses acrylic frames having lower placed belt tensioners and adds version number.
