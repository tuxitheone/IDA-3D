# Summary

This is a customized linear x-axis cable chain for the ANET A8 equipped with [my custom bowden carriage](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2099577)! This design may also work with other carriages.

<br>
**Notes regarding the chain mounts:**
The *chain mount attached to the x-axis motor* is a modified version of [davbarr](http://www.thingiverse.com/davbarr)'s design. The spacing/offset is slightly adopted to fit my custom carriage mount (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2099577) and further holes for zip ties are added.

The *chain mount attached to the carriage* is in minor parts inspired / adopted from [Starwhooper](http://www.thingiverse.com/Starwhooper)'s adapter plate (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1905344). The plate is highly customized to fit my custom bowden hotend mount (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2099577). You will need longer screws than the stock ones to fixate this plate - M4x12 did the job for me.

<br>
**Regarding chain elements, there are two options:**
* 26x closed chain elements - provided in the download section ([design](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1874802) by [sukhoi27](http://www.thingiverse.com/sukhoi27))
* 26x open chain elements, closed by zip ties (available in [Starwhooper](http://www.thingiverse.com/Starwhooper)'s [design](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1905344))

Step 1: Remove the 3 screws on the top right of your curriage.

Step 2: Insert new zip ties to the corresponding holes (skip this step with stock carriage)

Step 3: Mount cable chain adapter to carriage while gently pushing the zip ties in their designated clearance.

Step 4: Fixate cables with the zip ties. (I ran all cables from the carriage through the top right zip tie pointing from left to right)

Step 5: Bend all cables forward to the mounting point of the cable chain and fixate them with another zip tie as shown in the image.

Step 6: Thread all cables through the cable chain. (I did this one after another since the connectors would block each other)

Step 7: Attach the cable chain to the mount on the carriage.

Step 8: Attach the other cable chain mount to the x-axis motor using the stock screws. Afterwards thread all cables thorugh the designated hole on the adapter.

Step 9: Fixate all cables with a zip tie to the mount. I added another zip tie to cluster all cables right behind the mount, including the cables belonging to the x-axis end switch and the x-axis motor.
